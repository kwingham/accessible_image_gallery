User Stories

1. Responsive Design
   🐿️ As a user, I want the website design to adjust using media queries so that it works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens.
2. Accessibility with Alt Text ✅
   🐿️ As a user with visual impairments, I expect all images to have descriptive alt text so that my screen reader can convey the content effectively.
3. Image Navigation ✅
   🐿️ As a user, I want to easily switch between images in the gallery by clicking on thumbnails or navigation buttons so that I can view different images conveniently.
4. Keyboard Accessibility ✅
   🐿️ As a user who relies on keyboard navigation, I want to switch between images using the Tab key to focus on navigation buttons and Enter to select them, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.
5. Dynamic Image Loading ✅
   🐿️ As a user, I want the images to load dynamically as I navigate through the gallery, so that the initial load time of the page is minimised. ❌❓❔🤔 NB: I DONT THINK THAT THIS CRITERIA HAS BEEN MET?

6. Optimized Images with srcset
   🐿️ As a user, I want the website to use srcset to load appropriately sized images based on my device’s screen size, ensuring fast loading times and high image quality. ❌ NB: ALTHOUGH I HAVE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT SCREEN SIZING IN CSS I WASNT ABLE TO USE SRCSET AS I ONLY HAD ONE RESOLUTION PER IMAGE.
7. Advanced Accessibility with ARIA
   🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I want ARIA elements like aria-label, aria-live, and others to be used appropriately, improving my interaction with the website through assistive technologies. ❌✅ SOME ARIA ROLES AND PROPERTIES ARE USED (ROLE="BANNER", ARIA-LABEL, ARIA-LIVE), BUT THE USAGE OF ARIA COULD BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE, ESPECIALLY TO IMPROVE INTERACTION WITH ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES
8. Keyboard Shortcuts
   🐿️ As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts, like the left and right arrow keys, to switch between images easily, making navigation more efficient.
9. Enhanced Media Queries ✅
   🐿️ As a user on various devices, I want the website to adapt to different screen sizes, including tablets and large monitors, through the use of advanced media queries for an optimal viewing experience. ❌ NOT MET
10. Image Caption Accessibility
    🐿️ As a user with a screen reader, I want each image caption to be accessible and read aloud, so I can understand the context of each image. ✅
11. Dark Mode Toggle
    🐿️ As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark modes for the gallery, providing a comfortable viewing experience in different lighting conditions. ❌ NOT MET AS I RAN OUT OF TIME
12. Customizable Gallery Layout
    🐿️ As a user, I want the option to switch between different gallery layouts (e.g., grid, list, or carousel) so that I can view the images in a format that suits my preference.
13. Image Descriptions ❌ NOT MET AS I RAN OUT OF TIME
    🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I want each image to have a detailed description that provides context, helping me understand the visual content better. ✅

Reflections:

I mamaged to meet most of the user stories, but spent too much unexpected time in certain areas, in particular multiple areas involving images. On the upside I learnt a heck of alot and believe that I am better equiped for future projects. (well heres hoping! 😬🤞)
